# Setting up

- If you downloaded by clicking the "Download ZIP" button extract the contents of the zip file and remove the "-main" from the extracted folder's name
- Drag the downloaded FpvDrone folder into content manager, click on the menu icon(3 horizontal lines) at the top right corner, and click install.
- When in game open the FpvDrone app. If you use dualshock4 or xbox360 controllers select the corresponding preset and check if "Input device" setting in "Input" tab is right.
  If you have other controllers go to the "Input" tab and adjust every setting so the Input Display at the top of the app displays correctly.
- Set keybinds in the "Keybinds" tab to your liking.
